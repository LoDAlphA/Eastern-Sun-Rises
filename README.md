# Eastern-Sun-Rises 5.1D

Updated on 04.12.2017

This Mod began as a Community Patch for Eastern Sun. As I changed more and more, we slowly drifted away from our orgin and as such Eastern Sun Rises was born. You can find all informations the Mod about here:

Beware: You still need D2SE_ES R6E Com4.1N as a base over which you patch these files. You can find the Eastern Sun Database here:
